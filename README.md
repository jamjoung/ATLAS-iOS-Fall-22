# ATLAS-iOS-Fall-22

## Possible App Ideas:
- Journaling App 
  - Creative Themes that users can choose from
  - Allows for easy access, encourages consistency through small in-app rewards or customization options, etc
  - Users can store thoughts on current events, ideas, notes, recipes, to-do, reviews, etc. Focus on a few of these ideas
  - Be able to see your progress/consistency from an overall perspective (ex: githubs commit history,  coloring page where each day is a spot, etc)
  - I may use a Calendar API, but other than that I will need to do more research to see if I need any others.
